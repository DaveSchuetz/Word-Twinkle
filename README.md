# Word-Twinkle

Simple CSS animation. Display the text with a blink that gives it a bit of a twinkling feel.

Vary the animation time and the animation-delay to add to the twinkle effect.

            #h{
                animation: animate 1.8s infinite;
                animation-delay: 0s;
            }
            #e
            {
                animation: animate 2s infinite;
                animation-delay: .15s;
            }
